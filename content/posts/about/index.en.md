My name is Alex Lewanski, and I am interested in applying genomic and demographic information from simulations and empirical data to conserve imperiled taxa and infer evolutionary processes. I am a PhD student based at Michigan State Universityâ€™s [Kellogg Biological Station](https://www.kbs.msu.edu) and am coadvised by [Sarah Fitzpatrick](http://swfitz.com) and [Gideon Bradburd](http://www.genescape.org) (University of Michigan).

### My CV can be found [here](cv.pdf).
