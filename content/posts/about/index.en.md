I am a PhD student interested in applying genomic and demographic information from simulations and empirical data to conserve imperiled taxa and infer evolutionary processes. I am based at Michigan State Universityâ€™s [Kellogg Biological Station](https://www.kbs.msu.edu) and am coadvised by [Sarah Fitzpatrick](http://swfitz.com) and [Gideon Bradburd](http://www.genescape.org) (University of Michigan).

Work in progress ...
